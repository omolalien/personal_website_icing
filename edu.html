        <p>Here is my education journey. As you can see, my education started around 2009 until 2010 when I went to preschool at 5 to 6 years old. The name of my preschool was PraSekolah JAIS Pekan Sabak. Next, when I was 7 years old, I went to primary school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Doktor Abdul Latiff, Sabak Bernam. During 2016, I had to take an exam called "Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR)". Additionally, I attended a religious school named SRA Muhammadiah Pekan Sabak, Sabak Bernam. This school offered both general and religious education. I took religious lessons in subjects such as "Sirah", Morals ("Akhlak"), and "Tauhid". In 2016, I also took another exam called "Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah Agama (PSRA)". This exam is conducted for Year 6 students in Religious Primary Schools, Integration Religious Primary Schools, and Al-Quran and Fardhu Ain (KAFA) Integration Classes throughout Selangor.</p>
        <p>Moreover, I continued my education at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan (SMK) Ungku Aziz, Sabak Bernam. This school has two sessions: Form 1 and Form 2 students attend in the evening, while Form 3, Form 4, and Form 5 students attend in the morning. In 2019, I took the "Pentaksiran Tingkatan Tiga (PT3)" exam and achieved good results. For Form 4 students, there are subject packages that allow students to choose subjects they like. These include core subjects like "Bahasa Melayu", English, Mathematics, History, and Islamic Studies/Moral Education. Additionally, there are categories for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) and Humanities & Arts. In Form 4, I took Sports Science, Technical Graphics Communication, and Visual Art Education. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began, and I had my first experience with online classes. My examinations were also conducted online, and my "Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM)" exam was postponed. I took the SPM examination in 2022 and achieved excellent results.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am continuing my educational journey at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Cawangan Kedah, where I am pursuing a Diploma in Informatics Library (CDIM144). I hope to achieve good results this semester, graduate successfully, and continue my studies by pursuing a degree.</p>
